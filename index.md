# About Me

I am Aiden McVean, a first-year student at Michigan Technological University. I am currently working towards earning a MS in Data Science at the college. As much as I love programming and statistics, I also enjoy archery and biking (at least, when there isn't snow on the ground).
The home page is a little short as of now due to my recent enrollment, but there will be more projects and details posted here as I work on my courses and hobbies.

I have recently began working with Linux, git, and bash for a good number of my university projects. Alongside that, I have two years of experience in Java and a decent chunk of experience in Python, R, HTML, PHP, and SQL.

Over the next few months, I am also looking forward to applying as an on-campus tutor for Calculus I, Calculus II, and Linear Algebra.

A link to my contact information and resume can be found [here.](resume) A print version of the resume can either be found at the previous link or by [clicking here.](assets/files/resume.pdf)

Below is a list of a few projects which I'd like to highlight. Unfortunately, the only one available at the moment is the work I completed for the DATA1201 course. A full list of my projects can be found [here.](posts)
