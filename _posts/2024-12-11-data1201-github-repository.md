The main topics of this course's work involved using the Linux terminal, understanding the usage of git and bash, applying markdown to repositories, and using OpenRefine and regular expressions to sort through and clean data.

The course's content covered data obtaining and cleaning, proper visualization and interpretation of data, the goals and work of a data scientist, and methods of developing skillsets useful for data science.

The [repository for this class](https://github.com/amcvean/data1201) contains a README which breaks down the week-by-week assignments of the course alongside the files used in a few of the labs.
